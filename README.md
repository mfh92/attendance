# attendance
The data cover years 2006 to 2018 attendance at an annual conference in Monterey of the CA Mathematics Council of Community Colleges (CMC^3), though the group has existed since 1972.  It is the #1 best source of professional development for mathematics faculty at ANY community college, though its primary focus is the 58 CCs in Northern and Central CA.  With R + JavaScript code, a randomly chosen college is assigned to each attendee who listed multiple colleges on their registration form (about 15% of all attendees).  Faculty have the Potential to attend this event more often than they currently do.  Very few times has a college supported sending a significant proportion of their faculty to this conference, between 2006 and 2018.  Comments are welcome: mark.f.harbison@gmail.com .
